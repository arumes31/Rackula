### NetBox Device Type Library

**License:** [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

The NetBox devicetype-library provides the device type definitions that power Rackula's device library. This community-maintained collection contains hundreds of device definitions from manufacturers worldwide.

While CC0 requires no attribution, we credit the NetBox community for their extensive work maintaining this invaluable resource.

### Dracula Theme

**Project:** [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/)
**License:** [MIT](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/blob/main/LICENSE)

Rackula's visual design draws heavily from the Dracula color palette. The signature purples, pinks, and cyans that define Rackula's aesthetic come directly from Dracula's carefully crafted color scheme. Even our mascot name pays homage to this excellent theme.

## Thanks

These projects and communities don't require attribution, but we're grateful for their contributions:

### Device Images

**Project:** [vastoholic/draw-io](https://github.com/vastoholic/draw-io)

Many device images in Rackula come from vastoholic's Draw.io shape library. This collection of rack device SVGs saved countless hours of image work. Per the repository README, these files are "freely shareable to anyone who wishes to use them in any project" with no attribution required—but we appreciate the contribution nonetheless.
